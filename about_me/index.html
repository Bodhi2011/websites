            <p>My name is Eric Floyd, I'm 13 years old as of January 26, 2023. I have many hobbies like swimming, programming, and hiking. I started programming when I was twelve years old. I currently am learning several languages including HTML, JS, Python3, CSS, and C++. I have solved over two hundred leetcode problems including over 50 medium-level problems. I'm currently working on many  projects from websites to playable game AI.  You can see my past and current projects  in my github/leetcode account in  the top-right corner.</p>
